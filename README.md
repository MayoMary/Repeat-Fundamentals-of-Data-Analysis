Based on data as at 2008, 11 years ago...how mines get depleted adn demand exced supply.... + rise of online ..

This diamonds data set comes with the ggplot2 package and contains the prices and the specs for more than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Analyzing this data set is useful because diamonds are unique in the way that isn’t true of most manufactured products that we are used to buying. You can’t just put in a model number and look up the price.
