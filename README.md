# Repeat-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
Repeat project for Semester 2 Fundamentals of Data Analysis module

## Fundamentals-of-DA-Project

### Project Title : Fundamentals-of-DA-Project  
The project is based on the Diamonds dataset. Need to create a jupyter notebook investigating the Diamonds data set.......????????using the boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot

## Background : 


Diamonds dataset was 
introduced by Ronald Fischer, a british statistician and biologist in 1936. 
Fischer developed a linear model to distingush the species from each other. 
The dataset contains sets of data for 3 varieties of the Iris flower - Sentosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
50 data readings were collected for these 3 varieties under the following 4 attributes - sepal width and length and petal width and length. 
Need to import the data, create a box plot to see the data visually.

## Code language
Jupyter Notebooks using Python3

## Data source
As per [url link](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/datasets/raw/master/diamonds.csv) included in project instructions: 
This contains details for 53,940 diamonds for 10 variables including cut, carat, colour, clarity, depth, price, table, x and y ????????
Cut is classified further as Premium, Good, Ideal
????

PROBLEM WITH THE DATASET..
Based on data as at 2008, 11 years ago...jow mines get depleted adn demand exced supply.... + rise of online ..

This diamonds data set comes with the ggplot2 package and contains the prices and the specs for more than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Analyzing this data set is useful because diamonds are unique in the way that isn’t true of most manufactured products that we are used to buying. You can’t just put in a model number and look up the price.
