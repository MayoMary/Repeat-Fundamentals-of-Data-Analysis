# Repeat-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
Repeat project for Semester 2 Fundamentals of Data Analysis module

## Fundamentals-of-DA-Project

### Project Title : Fundamentals-of-DA-Project  
The project is based on the Diamonds dataset. Need to create a jupyter notebook investigating the Diamonds data set.......????????using the boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot

## Background : 
Diamonds dataset was 
introduced by Ronald Fischer, a british statistician and biologist in 1936. 
Fischer developed a linear model to distingush the species from each other. 
The dataset contains sets of data for 3 varieties of the Iris flower - Sentosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
50 data readings were collected for these 3 varieties under the following 4 attributes - sepal width and length and petal width and length. 
Need to import the data, create a box plot to see the data visually.

## Code language
Jupyter Notebooks using Python3

## Data source
As per url link included in project instructions: https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/datasets/raw/master/diamonds.csv
This contains details for 53,940 diamonds for 10 variables including cut, carat, colour, clarity, depth, price, table, x and y ????????
Cut is classified further as Premium, Good, Ideal
????

This diamonds data set comes with the ggplot2 package and contains the prices and the specs for more than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Analyzing this data set is useful because diamonds are unique in the way that isn’t true of most manufactured products that we are used to buying. You can’t just put in a model number and look up the price.

Saung Masin discusses the history of the market for diamonds: Hidden in the data are reflections of how a legendary marketing campaign permeated and was subsumed by our culture. Hints about how different social strata responded and how the diamond market functions today as a result. The story starts in 1870 when many tons of diamonds were discovered in South Africa near the Orange River. Until then, the diamond market had been small.

Only a few pounds of diamonds were mined each year from India and Brazil. At the time, there was no use for diamonds outside of jewelry, so price depended only on scarce supply. Hence, the project investors formed the De Beers Cartel in 1888 to try to control the global price of diamonds. By most accounts, this has been the most successful cartel in history. But World War I and the Great Depression saw diamond sales plummet.

In 1938 the De Beers Cartel contacted Philadelphia ad agency N.W. Ayer & Son to inquire whether, quote, “the use of propaganda in various forms might help jump start diamond sales in the U.S.” which looked like the only viable potential market for diamonds at the time.

Surveys showed, however, that among couples contemplating marriage, diamonds were low on the list of priorities: a luxury for the rich. Frances Gerety took on the the De Beers account at N.W. Ayer & Son and worked towards the company’s goal to quote “create a situationin which every couple contemplating marriage feels the need to acquire a diamond engagement ring.” A few years later she contined a famous slogan.

A diamonds is forever!
This slogan has appeared in every De Beers ad since 1948. In 1999, two weeks before Mrs. Gerety died, Advertising Age named it the slogan of the century!
