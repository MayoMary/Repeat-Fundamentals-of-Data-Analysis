## Project Title : Fundamentals-of-DA-Project : Repeat Project 2019  
The project is based on the Diamonds dataset. A jupyter notebook in Python 3 is created to investigating the Diamonds data set.

## Describing the dataset
This diamonds data set comes with the ggplot2 package and contains the prices and the specs for more than 50,000 diamonds collected in 2008 from diamondsc.info. Analyzing this data set is useful because diamonds are unique in the way that isn’t true of most manufactured products that we are used to buying. You can’t just put in a model number and look up the price.


Description of the variables(columns) in the dataset Data set. [4]
It is a data frame with 53,940 rows and 10 variables. A description of the variables follows:

* Price - price in US dollars

* Carat - weight of the diamond

* Cut - quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

* Colour - diamond colour ranging from D, E, F, G, H, I, J

* Clarity - a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 - I3(worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

* Depth - total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y)

  * x - length in mm.

  * y - width in mm.

  * z - depth in mm.

* Table - width of top of diamond in relation to it's widest point.
